# PlayableSora - Play as Final Form Sora!
#### By Matarra

## Adds an entirely new custom survivor: Final Form Sora from Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix
### Passive Skill:
 - Superglide - Hold jump while midair to glide at high speed. Scales with movement speed.

### Primary Skill [M1]:
 - Final Arts - Sora attacks with both his keyblades, unleashing an attack dependent on whether you're grounded or not. 
  - Sora can seamlessly transition from grounded to aerial combos and vise versa if you manage to touch ground or become airborne during the combo.
  - Scales with attack speed up to a cap.
  - You have invincibility frames during the finisher attack.
  - You can cancel any non-finisher attack mid-combo with your Utility Skill - Quick Run.
  - You can input-buffer another attack, or a magic command mid-attack to cast it slightly faster.
  - Aerial attacks will move you towards the closest enemy, or whichever enemy you're pointing at via cursor.

### Secondary Skill [M2]:
 - Thundaga - Sora calls down 7 bolts of lightning to strike nearby enemies.
  - These bolts deal AoE damage.
  - These bolts will lock-on to nearby enemies, prioritizing closer enemies.
  - Costs 20 MP, can be casted even if less than 20 MP remain, which will consume any remaining MP.
  - Cannot be cancelled with Quick Run.

### Utility Skill [Shift]:
 - Quick Run - Sora performs a quick dash in given direction. Dashes in the direction he is moving, not facing.

### Special Skill [R]:
 - Magnega - Sora creates a vortex of magnetic force which draws in nearby enemies.
 - Will not draw in Elite or Boss type enemies.
 - Costs 65 MP, can be casted even if less than 65 MP remain, which will consume any remaining MP.

## Model / Anims
- Model, animations, and textures were ripped from Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix and imported / blended in unity. All keyblade movements were re-animated by me.

## Stats
 - Base Jump Power = 20
 - Base Jump Count = 2
 - Base Max Health = 145
 - Health per Level = 45
 - Base regen = 4
 - Regen per Level = 0.7
 - Base armor = 18
 - MP Restoration time = 20s
 - Everything else is the same as base Commando.

## Fully Multiplayer Compatible âœ“
 - Currently aware of a bug that allows items on sora to be visible for other clients. (Items are not supposed to be visible on his character body).
 - Sounds are only audible for the client playing sora. This is not a bug, but a choice.
