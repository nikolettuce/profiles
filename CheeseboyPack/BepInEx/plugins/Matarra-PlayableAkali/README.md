# PlayableAkali - Play as Akali from League of Legends!
#### By Matarra

## Adds an entirely new custom survivor: Akali from League of Legends

### Kit
- Her kit features the her Passive, Q, W(shroud) and her ultimate from league of legends. They work and function exactly as expected from the actual game and have more detailed descriptions with numbers in game.

## Model / Anims
- Model, animations, and textures were ripped from League of Legends and imported / blended in unity. Particles created by me.

## Stats
 - Base Jump Power = 20
 - Base Jump Count = 2
 - Base Max Health = 145
 - Health per Level = 45
 - Base regen = 4
 - Regen per Level = 0.7
 - Base armor = 18
 - Everything else is the same as base Commando.

## Fully Multiplayer Compatible âœ“
 - Currently aware of a bug that allows items on akali to be visible for other clients. (Items are not supposed to be visible on her character body).
