# Fallen Friends - Now works in singleplayer!
#### by Evaisa <3


Hey there! Thanks for checking out my mod! 

This mod makes it so that whenever you die instead of spectating you take control of one of your allys!
From drones to turrets to beetle guards!
				
### Patch Notes:


3.5.1

* Hopefully fix issue with the mod not working properly in multiplayer.


3.5.0

* Updated for 1.0!


3.4.0

* Add anti healing drone and whatever check for 1 player multiplayer.
* Possibly broke everything but I can't be bothered to test.


3.2.0

* Hopefully prevent players from spawning as turrets when alone.

3.1.0

* Added a configuration option to respawn players as drones if they do not own any allies. You can only respawn only once per stage.
* Added a configuration option to respawn any amount of times instead of the default only 1 respawn per stage. Mixed with RespawnWithoutAllies this is a cheat setting and you will never die.


3.0.0

* Lets start from scratch, any other version can be seen as broken. Update right now.
* The singleplayer update! This mod was not meant for singleplayer use originally but now it should work!
* If used in singleplayer you can only turn into a ally once per stage.
* In singleplayer you cannot turn into turrets or healing drones, to prevent getting locked in a stage.


## Installation

* Drop FallenFriends.dll in your plugins folder.
